Text based game created as part of a Computer Science Java module. A similar game for a different module was also made with a Java GUI, screenshot for this game available [here](http://i.imgur.com/4JsQhuQ.png).

##Future Extenstions
Extending the base of the project to involve a GUI, either through Java or a complete overhaul using HTML5/JS.
